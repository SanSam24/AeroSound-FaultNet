This project uses two publicly available large-scale audio datasets.
Due to GitHub’s storage limits, they are not included in this repository.
Use the provided download_data.sh script to fetch and extract them automatically.

1️⃣ AeroSonicDB (Aircraft Engine Audio)

Link: Kaggle – Audio Dataset of Low-Flying Aircraft (AeroSonicDB)

Description: Contains over 27 GB of real-world aircraft engine and propeller recordings from low-flying planes and helicopters.

Purpose: Core dataset for building the fault recognition model — used to analyze and simulate engine anomalies.

License: Free for research and non-commercial use under Kaggle’s dataset terms.

2️⃣ ESC-50 (Environmental Sound Classification)

Link: GitHub – ESC-50 Dataset by Karol Piczak

Description: A curated collection of 2,000 environmental sound recordings across 50 classes, such as wind, rain, thunder, and machinery.

Purpose: Used to simulate real-world noise conditions and test the model’s robustness under variable signal-to-noise ratios.
